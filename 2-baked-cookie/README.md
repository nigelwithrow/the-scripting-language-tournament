Last challenge was way too hard, sorry for that.
However, you can still try to implement one of the
simpler solutions, late submissions are allowed.

This challenge heavily reminds me of one particular
contest I did. It was FUN

_A baker baked an image. Using baker's map._ You need it back :)
Do not send the resulting image, only the code that you used to get it.

You are allowed to use packages from a package manager for your language.
C is allowed to use single-header libraries.
BASH is allowed to use any binary that exists in nixpkgs stable and can't
be considered a compiler/interpreter.
I suggest checking with me if you are not sure about allowance
of a package/program.

### Scoring
This challenge will be scored using the following formula:
```python
(min(1300 / runtime_ms, 1) + min(50 / token_count, 1) + elegance_score) / 3
```

#### Results
|  Language  | Time | Token | Elegance | **Result** |
